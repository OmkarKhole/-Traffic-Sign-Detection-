# -Traffic-Sign-Detection Project
My mini project on Traffic Sign Detection. I used the Landing AI platform to build and deploy a computer vision model that can detect various traffic signs like speed limits from 20 to 120 speed limit, green and red signals and stop boards. I'll show you how the model works and the process of training and labeling the data. You can see the vedio on a link which is provided. The project is aimed at helping autonomous vehicles navigate the roads more effectively.It is still in its initial stages and I developed it as a mini project , really excited to work on it in future!
